# Ollama Proof of Concept

This repo is a collection of code snippets I've put together to act as proof of concepts for my journey on teaching myself AI programming. Note that the code will be mostly (if not all) in Python.

In most cases, I've annotated code with as much notes as feasible. This is as much as for the benefit of others, as it is for myself :)
