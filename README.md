# Ollama Proof of Concepts (PoCs)

This repo is a collection of code snippets I've put together to act as proof of concepts for my journey on teaching myself AI programming. Note that the code will be mostly (if not all) in Python.

In most cases, I've annotated code with as much notes as feasible. This is as much as for the benefit of others, as it is for myself :)

## Pre-requisites
The following will be necessary for all scripts in here - unless the local README specifies otherwise
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) - to run LLMs locally
* [Meta Llama 3.2 1B Model](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2:1b) - downloaded within Ollama
* Familiarity with Python - obviously
* A Python virtual dev environment - i use Python's built-in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Before getting started
I have created each sub-folder so that
* It will act as the home folder for the PoC within
* There will be a README explaining what the PoC is about
* It will need a dedicated python virtual environment
* There will also be a requirements.txt - which should list the packages necessary

# Any questions? Or spot an error or typo? Or see an improvement?
* Fork this repo and contribute it as a PR :)
* OR simply raise a new issue on this repo with the details
